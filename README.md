# Autonomous-Trading-Agent

This repository is organized to support a QC → Brain JSON → Local LEAN (or Alpaca) runtime workflow for an autonomous TSLA bot.

Key locations:
- `bot/` — runtime skeleton (brains, src, tests)
- `qc org wkspc dir/ATA/` — QuantConnect Research / training code and models
- `docs/BOT_SPEC.md` — high level spec and roadmap

Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and follow `docs/PLAN.md` to get started.
