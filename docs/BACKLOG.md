## 🔴 High Priority

### Brain Retraining (Current Focus)
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Retrain expert models + brain on 2018-2024 TSLA data to improve AUC from ~0.50-0.52 to ≥0.55.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Pull TSLA minute data (2018-2024) from QuantConnect
- [ ] Resample to 5-minute bars
- [ ] Build cost-aware 60-minute forward labels
- [ ] Train RSI/MACD/Trend experts with hyperparameter search
- [ ] Train brain with expert predictions + regime features
- [ ] Export JSONs and sync to local `/models/`
- [ ] Backtest with brain ON (edge ≥0.10, cap 0.20%)
- [ ] Promote only if beats RSI baseline after costs

**Acceptance**:
- AUC ≥ 0.55 on hold-out set
- Brain outperforms RSI in walk-forward backtest
- JSONs uploaded to QC Object Store + local `/models/`

**Blockers**: None

### Drift Monitor
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Detect feature distribution shifts in live data vs. training data.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Track feature statistics (mean, std) for each expert
- [ ] Compute Kolmogorov-Smirnov test weekly
- [ ] Alert if any feature drifts beyond 2-sigma threshold
- [ ] Log drift metrics to CSV for analysis

**Acceptance**:
- Alert triggered if RSI distribution shifts ≥20%
- Weekly drift report emailed/logged

**Blockers**: None

---

### Alert System (Slack/Email)
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Send notifications on kill-switch triggers, daily stop hits, or drift alerts.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate Slack webhook for critical alerts
- [ ] Send email on daily P&L stop (-1%)
- [ ] Send email on 60-day certification completion
- [ ] Log all alerts to CSV

**Acceptance**:
- Slack message sent within 1 minute of daily stop trigger
- Email includes trade log summary + P&L

**Blockers**: None

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Walk-Forward Validation Pipeline
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Automate rolling 3-month train/test cycles to validate brain robustness.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Script to partition data into rolling windows
- [ ] Train brain on each window
- [ ] Backtest on next month (out-of-sample)
- [ ] Aggregate metrics (Sharpe, max DD, win rate)
- [ ] Fail if any window underperforms baseline

**Acceptance**:
- Brain validated on ≥12 rolling windows (1 year)
- All windows beat RSI baseline (Sharpe ≥0.8)

**Blockers**: High-priority brain retraining must complete first

---

### Multi-Symbol Support
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Expand from TSLA-only to small basket (AAPL, MSFT, SPY).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Generalize feature builder to accept symbol parameter
- [ ] Train expert models for each symbol (3 x 3 = 9 models)
- [ ] Portfolio optimization (allocate capital across symbols)
- [ ] Risk controls: max 3 concurrent positions

**Acceptance**:
- Algo runs on 4 symbols simultaneously
- Position sizing respects portfolio-level caps
- Backtest shows diversification benefit (lower DD)

**Blockers**: Single-symbol brain must be stable first

---

### Performance Analytics Dashboard
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Visualize trade performance, P&L curves, and risk metrics.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Parse `alpaca_rsi_log.csv` into Pandas DataFrame
- [ ] Plot cumulative P&L, drawdown, Sharpe over time
- [ ] Trade heatmap (entry/exit RSI vs. return)
- [ ] Export HTML report

**Acceptance**:
- Dashboard auto-generated weekly from CSV logs
- Sharpe, Sortino, max DD visible at a glance

**Blockers**: None

---

## 🟢 Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

### Regime Filters
**Priority**: 🟢 Low  
**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Reduce position sizes during high-volatility regimes.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Compute VIX-like metric (rolling 20-day ATR)
- [ ] Scale position size by inverse volatility
- [ ] Backtest regime-aware sizing vs. fixed sizing

---

### RL-Based Position Sizing
**Priority**: 🟢 Low  
**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Use reinforcement learning to optimize position sizing vs. fixed ATR-based.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Define RL environment (state: features, action: size, reward: Sharpe)
- [ ] Train PPO/DDPG agent on historical data
- [ ] Compare RL sizing vs. ATR baseline

---

### Trade Journal
**Priority**: 🟢 Low  
**Status**: Not Started

**Goal**: Detailed logging of every trade with entry/exit reasons, P&L, slippage.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Expand CSV to include: slippage, commission, hold time
- [ ] Add post-trade analysis (did stop/TP trigger? or time decay?)
