## 🔴 High Priority (Week 6 - Current)

### Week 6 Paper Trading Validation + Phase 3 Deployment
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Phase 3.1+3.2 Deployed, Monitoring  
**Owner**: User

**Goal**: Validate Phase 1+2 execution works correctly in live environment, deploy Phase 3 enhancements.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Deploy bot to DigitalOcean droplet (138.68.150.144)
- [x] Fix timezone bug (UTC → US/Eastern for time_of_day filter)
- [x] Loosen filters temporarily (vol_z 0.5→0.2, volm_z 1.0→0.3) for faster validation
- [x] Verify bot running 24/7 (process 44394)
- [x] **First trade execution** (Dec 18, 15:54 UTC - 5 TSLA @ $484.74)
- [x] Monitor bracket orders (stop-loss, take-profit) execute correctly
- [x] Discovered churning issue with ultra-loose filters (vol_z > 0.0)
- [x] Restored production filters (vol_z > 0.2, volm_z > 0.3)
- [x] Make go/no-go decision for Phase 3 implementation (GO - execution validated)
- [x] **Phase 3.1 Deployed**: ATR-based trailing stops (18:07 UTC, PID 46125)
- [x] **Phase 3.2 Deployed**: Multi-timeframe RSI confirmation (18:24 UTC, PID 46592)
- [x] **Day 2 Health Check** (Dec 19): Bot healthy, no trades (expected - holiday low volatility)
- [ ] **Holiday Period Monitoring** (Dec 19 - Jan 3): Bot running, zero trades expected
- [ ] **First Phase 3 Entry** (Expected: Early Jan - TSLA delivery numbers catalyst)
- [ ] **Validation Period** (Jan 6-31): Collect 5-10 Phase 3 trades during Q4 earnings volatility
- [ ] Validate skip_multi_tf and trail_update logs after first entry
- [ ] Run analyze_recent_trades.py after 5+ trades collected

**Expected Timeline** (Seasonal Volatility Analysis):
- **Dec 19-23**: Low probability trades (pre-holiday quiet period)
- **Dec 23 - Jan 3**: Very low probability (holiday period, skeleton crews)
- **Jan 6-10**: First trades likely (TSLA Q4 delivery numbers, fresh capital returns)
- **Jan 20-31**: High-volume validation period (Q4 earnings week, ±5-10% TSLA moves typical)
- **Target**: 5-15 Phase 3 trades by Feb 1, 2026

**Next Steps** (After Validation - Feb 2026):
1. **Shadow ML Decision**: Enable ML_SHADOW_ENABLED=true if Phase 3 stable (start collecting training data)
   - ML stays dormant, only logs features + outcomes
   - Zero risk to execution (try/except wrapper)
   - Target: 500+ labeled trades over 6 months
2. **Phase 3.3 Evaluation**: Assess need for additional enhancements based on Phase 3.1+3.2 results:
   - ATR acceleration (tighten trail as profit grows)
   - Partial profit-taking (scale out at milestones)
   - Time-based stops (exit stale positions)
3. **Live Trading Consideration**: If Phase 3 Sharpe ≥ 1.0, consider moving to real money

**Acceptance**:
- ✅ Bracket orders place correctly (stop-loss, take-profit)
- ✅ Entry/exit timing matches expected behavior
- ✅ No critical errors or missed signals
- ✅ Execution infrastructure fully validated (Dec 18 first trade)
- 🔄 Phase 3 validation: 5-10 clean trades (expected by Jan 31, 2026)

**Current Status** (Dec 19):
- Bot healthy: PID 46592, running 27+ hours
- Market conditions: Low volatility (vol_z < 0, volm_z < 0)
- Filter status: Correctly rejecting setups (skip_volatility, skip_volume)
- Position: Flat (orphaned position manually closed Dec 18)

**Blockers**: 
- ✅ None - waiting for market volatility to return (seasonal pattern)

### Phase 3 Planning (Ready to Implement After Validation)
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Design Complete, Implementation Waiting  
**Owner**: User

**Goal**: Enhance Phase 1+2 strategy with advanced techniques (trailing stops, multi-TF RSI).

**Phase 3.1 - Trailing ATR Stop**:
- [x] Design document created ([PHASE3_TRAILING_STOP_DESIGN.md](PHASE3_TRAILING_STOP_DESIGN.md))
- [x] Researched Alpaca order.replace() API
- [x] Implement trailing stop logic in alpaca_rsi_bot.py (Dec 18, 17:47 UTC)
- [x] Deploy to paper trading (running on droplet PID 46592)
- [ ] Validate trail behavior with first profitable position (waiting on Jan volatility)
- [ ] Backtest vs Phase 2 baseline after live validation (target: +10% Sharpe)

**Note**: Trailing stop code ready, awaiting first Phase 3 entry (expected Jan 6-31)

**Phase 3.2 - Multi-Timeframe RSI**:
- [x] Design document created ([PHASE3_MULTI_TF_RSI_DESIGN.md](PHASE3_MULTI_TF_RSI_DESIGN.md))
- [x] Selected approach: Option B (5m <25, 15m <50)
- [x] Implement 15-min RSI consolidation (Dec 18, 18:24 UTC)
- [x] Add multi-TF filter to entry logic
- [x] Deploy to paper trading (running on droplet PID 46592)
- [ ] Validate skip_multi_tf logs with first new entry (waiting on Jan volatility)
- [ ] Backtest vs Phase 2 baseline after collecting trades (target: +10% Sharpe)

**Note**: Multi-TF filter not yet reached (early filters rejecting due to low vol/volume)

**Phase 3.3 - Additional Enhancements** (Optional):
- [ ] Design ATR acceleration (tighten trail as profit increases)
- [ ] Design partial profit-taking (scale out at +1ATR, +2ATR, +3ATR)
- [ ] Design time-based stops (exit if no profit after 2 hours)
- [ ] Evaluate need based on Phase 3.1+3.2 performance

**Acceptance**:
- Trailing stops: Sharpe improves ≥10% vs Phase 2 (target: 0.88+)
- Multi-TF RSI: Win rate improves +3-5%, trade reduction <40%
- Combined Phase 3: Sharpe ≥1.0

**Dependencies**: ✅ Week 6 execution validation complete. Now waiting on market volatility (Jan 2026)

**Filter Decision**: Keeping current filters (vol_z > 0.2, volm_z > 0.3) - loosened from backtest but still selective. Analysis shows holiday period (Dec 19 - Jan 3) has historically low TSLA volatility. Expecting trades to resume in early January with delivery numbers catalyst, and high-volume validation during Q4 earnings (late Jan).

- [ ] Enable ML_SHADOW_ENABLED=true after Week 6 validation
- [ ] Collect 500+ trades over 6 months
- [ ] Analyze: Does ML improve expectancy vs rule-based filters?
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision based on out-of-sample expectancy (not AUC)

**Acceptance**:
- JSONL log contains 500+ trades with features + outcomes
- If ML expectancy > baseline + 2σ → Train model and promote
