## 🔴 High Priority

### RSI Phase 1+2 Deployment (COMPLETED)
**Priority**: 🔴 High → ✅ Complete  
**Status**: Complete (Dec 17, 2025) - Deployed to paper trading  
**Owner**: TBD

**Result**: Phase 1+2 backtest (2020-2024 TSLA) achieved **Sharpe 0.80** (vs baseline -0.11), Win Rate 72.7%, Profit Factor 0.93. All acceptance criteria exceeded (+97% Sharpe improvement, +6.1% win rate improvement). Strategy deployed to Alpaca paper trading.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Implement Phase 1 filters (time-of-day, volume, volatility)
- [x] Implement Phase 2 enhancements (dynamic RSI, trend filter, BB confirmation)
- [x] Create backtest comparison script (baseline vs Phase 1 vs Phase 1+2)
- [x] Run 2020-2024 TSLA backtest in QuantConnect
- [x] Measure metrics: Sharpe, win rate, max DD, trade count
- [x] Document results in RSI_ENHANCEMENTS.md
- [x] Deploy to Alpaca paper trading
- [ ] Monitor paper trading 5-7 days (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Compare live results vs backtest predictions

**Acceptance**: ✅ ALL MET
- Sharpe improved by +97% (far exceeds +10% target)
- Win rate +6.1% (exceeds +5% target)
- Trade count reduced 74% (168→44, quality over quantity)

**Next**: Week 6 monitoring and infrastructure setup

### Brain Retraining (COMPLETED - NOT PROMOTED)
**Priority**: 🔴 High → ✅ Complete  
**Status**: Complete (Dec 17, 2025)  
**Owner**: TBD

**Result**: Tested multiple configurations (H=6/12/24, 2018-2024 data, LightGBM hyperparameter tuning). All yielded AUC 0.50-0.52 (coin-flip). **Decision: Brain not promoted. RSI baseline remains champion.** Public OHLCV features on liquid stocks have limited predictive power. Models archived in `models/*.json` for reference. See DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for full analysis.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Financial markets are adversarial - basic technical indicators on public data unlikely to achieve strong edge
- AUC 0.50-0.52 is expected ceiling with OHLCV-derived features
- Real edge requires alternative data (order flow, sentiment, options) or microstructure features
- RSI baseline works due to strict risk management (ATR brackets, daily stop), not prediction

- [ ] Log all trades to alpaca_rsi_log.csv
- [ ] Investigate any significant deviations
- [ ] Make go/no-go decision for live trading

**Acceptance**:
- Paper trading Sharpe ≥1.0 (target)
- Win rate ≥70%
- Profit factor ≥0.9
- Results consistent with backtest (±20%)

**Blockers**: None (runs during US market hours 10 AM-3:30 PM ET)

### Drift Monitor
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (Week 6)  
**Status**: Not Started

- [ ] Compute Kolmogorov-Smirnov test weekly
- [ ] Alert if any feature drifts beyond 2-sigma threshold
- [ ] Log drift metrics to CSV for analysis

**Acceptance**:
- Alert triggered if RSI distribution shifts ≥20%
- Weekly drift report emailed/logged

**Blockers**: None

### Alert System (Slack/Email)
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (Week 6)  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Send notifications on kill-switch triggers, daily stop hits, or drift alerts.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate Slack webhook for critical alerts
- [ ] Send email on daily P&L stop (-1%)
- [ ] Send email on 60-day certification completion
- [ ] Log all alerts to CSV

**Acceptance**:
- Slack message sent within 1 minute of daily stop trigger

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Walk-Forward Validation Pipeline
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Automate rolling 3-month train/test cycles to validate brain robustness.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Script to partition data into rolling windows
- [ ] Train brain on each window
- [ ] Backtest on next month (out-of-sample)
- [ ] Aggregate metrics (Sharpe, max DD, win rate)
- [ ] Fail if any window underperforms baseline

**Acceptance**:
- Brain validated on ≥12 rolling windows (1 year)
- All windows beat RSI baseline (Sharpe ≥0.8)

**Blockers**: High-priority brain retraining must complete first

---

### Multi-Symbol Support
**Priority**: 🟡 Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD

**Goal**: Expand from TSLA-only to small basket (AAPL, MSFT, SPY).

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Generalize feature builder to accept symbol parameter
- [ ] Train expert models for each symbol (3 x 3 = 9 models)
- [ ] Portfolio optimization (allocate capital across symbols)
- [ ] Risk controls: max 3 concurrent positions

**Acceptance**:
- Algo runs on 4 symbols simultaneously
- Position sizing respects portfolio-level caps
- Backtest shows diversification benefit (lower DD)

**Blockers**: Single-symbol brain must be stable first
