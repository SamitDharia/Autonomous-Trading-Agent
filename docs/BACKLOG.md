## 🔴 High Priority (Week 6 - Current)

### Week 6 Paper Trading Validation + Phase 3 Deployment
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Status**: Phase 3.1+3.2 Deployed, Monitoring  
**Owner**: User

**Goal**: Validate Phase 1+2 execution works correctly in live environment, deploy Phase 3 enhancements.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Deploy bot to DigitalOcean droplet (138.68.150.144)
- [x] Fix timezone bug (UTC → US/Eastern for time_of_day filter)
- [x] Loosen filters temporarily (vol_z 0.5→0.2, volm_z 1.0→0.3) for faster validation
- [x] Verify bot running 24/7 (process 44394)
- [x] **First trade execution** (Dec 18, 15:54 UTC - 5 TSLA @ $484.74)
- [x] Monitor bracket orders (stop-loss, take-profit) execute correctly
- [x] Discovered churning issue with ultra-loose filters (vol_z > 0.0)
- [x] Restored production filters (vol_z > 0.2, volm_z > 0.3)
- [x] Make go/no-go decision for Phase 3 implementation (GO - execution validated)
- [x] **Phase 3.1 Deployed**: ATR-based trailing stops (18:07 UTC, PID 46125)
- [x] **Phase 3.2 Deployed**: Multi-timeframe RSI confirmation (18:24 UTC, PID 46592)
- [ ] **Wait 3-5 days**: Monitor orphaned position exit, collect first Phase 3 entry
- [ ] Validate skip_multi_tf and trail_update logs
- [ ] Collect 5-10 clean trades with Phase 3.1+3.2 for analysis
- [ ] Run analyze_recent_trades.py to check Phase 3 performance

**Next Steps** (After 3-5 Days):
1. **Shadow ML Decision**: Enable ML_SHADOW_ENABLED=true if Phase 3 stable (start collecting training data)
   - ML stays dormant, only logs features + outcomes
   - Zero risk to execution (try/except wrapper)
   - Target: 500+ labeled trades over 6 months
2. **Phase 3.3 Evaluation**: Assess need for additional enhancements based on Phase 3.1+3.2 results:
   - ATR acceleration (tighten trail as profit grows)
   - Partial profit-taking (scale out at milestones)
   - Time-based stops (exit stale positions)
3. **Live Trading Consideration**: If Phase 3 Sharpe ≥ 1.0, consider moving to real money

**Acceptance**:
- ✅ Bracket orders place correctly (stop-loss, take-profit)
- ✅ Entry/exit timing matches expected behavior
- ✅ No critical errors or missed signals
- 🔄 At least 3 clean trades executed (1 complete, churning trades excluded)

**Blockers**: 
- None - execution infrastructure fully validated

**Next Steps**:
1. Check dashboard at 3 PM Ireland (10 AM ET): https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard
2. If successful → Implement Phase 3.1 (trailing stops)
3. If errors → Debug bracket orders, delay Phase 3

- [x] Deploy to paper trading (running on droplet PID 46592)
- [ ] Validate trail behavior with first profitable position
- [ ] Backtest vs Phase 2 baseline after live validation (target: +10% Sharpe)

**Phase 3.2 - Multi-Timeframe RSI**:
- [x] Design document created ([PHASE3_MULTI_TF_RSI_DESIGN.md](PHASE3_MULTI_TF_RSI_DESIGN.md))
- [x] Selected approach: Option B (5m <25, 15m <50)
- [x] Implement 15-min RSI consolidation (Dec 18, 18:24 UTC)
- [x] Add multi-TF filter to entry logic
- [x] Deploy to paper trading (running on droplet PID 46592)
- [ ] Validate skip_multi_tf logs with first new entry
- [ ] Backtest vs Phase 2 baseline after collecting trades (target: +10% Sharpe)

**Phase 3.3 - Additional Enhancements** (Optional):
- [ ] Design ATR acceleration (tighten trail as profit increases)
- [ ] Design partial profit-taking (scale out at +1ATR, +2ATR, +3ATR)
- [ ] Design time-based stops (exit if no profit after 2 hours)
- [ ] Evaluate need based on Phase 3.1+3.2 performance

**Acceptance**:
- Trailing stops: Sharpe improves ≥10% vs Phase 2 (target: 0.88+)
- Multi-TF RSI: Win rate improves +3-5%, trade reduction <40%
- Combined Phase 3: Sharpe ≥1.0
