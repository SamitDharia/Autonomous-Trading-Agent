# Session Handoff: December 19-22, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on strategic planning, operational setup, and documentation maintenance after Phase 3 deployment.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Maximum Returns Path Design
- **Purpose**: Long-term growth roadmap targeting 12-22% annual returns
- **File**: docs/BACKLOG.md (Maximum Returns Path section)
- **Key Details**:
  - 5 phases over 2026-2027 timeline
  - Phase 1: Multi-symbol (5 stocks) → 2-4% annual return
  - Phase 2: 2% position sizing → 8-12% annual return
  - Phase 3: Loosen filters (HIGH RISK) → 12-16% annual return
  - Phase 4: Momentum strategy → 16-20% annual return
  - Phase 5: ML expectancy filter → 18-22% annual return
  - Realistic probabilities: 70% → 70% → 40% → 30% → 20%
  - Most likely outcome: 8-12% annual return (Phases 1-2 only)
  - Capital requirements: $5K minimum, $10K+ recommended
  - Correlation risk management included (max 2 concurrent if correlation < 0.75)
  - Strict validation gates between phases (win rate, Sharpe, profit factor)

### 2. Daily Monitoring Setup
- **Files Created**:
  - scripts/daily_health_check.ps1 (automated monitoring script)
  - docs/DAILY_MONITORING.md (comprehensive manual guide)
- **Features**:
  - 5 automated checks: bot process, logs, daily trades, Phase 3 activity, summary
  - Color-coded output (Green/Red/Yellow)
  - Manual commands for detailed analysis
  - Troubleshooting reference
- **Usage**: `.\scripts\daily_health_check.ps1` (30 seconds daily)

### 3. Monetization Roadmap
- **Short-term** (2026): Build 6-12 month track record
- **Mid-term** (2027): Prop firm evaluation ($100K-500K funded accounts)
- **Long-term** (2028+): Personal capital scaling ($50K-200K → $50K+/year income)
- **Timeline**: 2-4 years to meaningful income ($50K+/year)
- **Realistic expectations**: 70% confidence in 8-12% returns (Phases 1-2), 30% confidence in full 18-22% (all phases)

### 4. Documentation Audit & Cleanup
- **Audit File**: docs/DOC_AUDIT_2025-12-22.md
- **Results**: 92% health score (Excellent) across 17 markdown files
- **Issues Found**:
  1. CURRENT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md outdated and misplaced (root instead of docs/)
  2. TRAINING.md deprecated (brain ensemble abandoned)
  3. INDEX.md missing references (DAILY_MONITORING.md, Maximum Returns Path)
- **Cleanup Actions**:
  - Created docs/SESSION_HANDOFFS/ for ephemeral session logs
  - Created docs/archive/ for deprecated documentation
  - Moved session handoffs to proper location
  - Archived TRAINING.md with deprecation notice
  - Updated INDEX.md with missing references

## Current Bot Status (Dec 22, 2025)

### Deployment
- **Process**: PID 46592 on DigitalOcean droplet (138.68.150.144)
- **Uptime**: 72+ hours (deployed Dec 18, 18:24 UTC)
- **Phase**: 3.1 (trailing stops) + 3.2 (multi-TF RSI) active
- **Health**: Excellent - all checks passing

### Market Conditions
- **Volatility**: Low (vol_z < 0, volm_z < 0)
- **Filter Behavior**: Correctly rejecting setups (skip_volatility, skip_volume)
- **Expected Trades**: Zero until early January (holiday period Dec 19 - Jan 3)

### Filters (Current)
- vol_z > 0.2 (already 2-3x looser than backtest 0.5)
- volm_z > 0.3 (already 2-3x looser than backtest 1.0)
- time_of_day: 10:00-15:30 ET
- rsi_15m < 50 (Phase 3.2 multi-timeframe confirmation)
- Trailing stops: 1.5 × ATR (Phase 3.1)

## Timeline & Expectations

### Dec 22 - Jan 3: Holiday Period
- **Expected**: Zero trades (markets quiet, low volatility)
- **Action**: Daily monitoring only (run daily_health_check.ps1)
- **Goal**: Confirm bot stability, no changes needed

### Jan 6-31: Validation Window
- **Catalysts**: TSLA delivery numbers (early Jan), Q4 earnings (late Jan)
- **Expected**: 5-15 trades total
  - Early Jan (6-10): First Phase 3 entry likely (TSLA catalyst)
  - Late Jan (20-31): High activity (earnings week, 3-7 trades)
- **Validation**: Check for skip_multi_tf and trail_update logs
- **Analysis**: After 5+ trades, run `python scripts/analyze_recent_trades.py --days 30`

### Feb 2025: Decision Point
- **If Phase 3 validated** (Sharpe ≥ 0.7, win rate ≥ 65%):
  - Begin Maximum Returns Path Phase 1 (multi-symbol backtest design)
  - Backtest AAPL, NVDA, SPY, QQQ with current Phase 3 filters
  - Analyze correlation and diversification opportunities
- **If needs tuning**:
  - Adjust filters/parameters based on real trades
  - Iterate before expanding to multi-symbol

## Technical Notes

### Filter Loosening Context
- **Current deployment**: vol_z > 0.2, volm_z > 0.3
- **Backtest baseline**: vol_z > 0.5, volm_z > 1.0
- **Already loosened**: 2-3x from backtest strict filters
- **Estimated frequency**: ~20 trades/year (vs 9 in backtest)
- **Risk**: Further loosening approaches losing territory (baseline Sharpe -0.11)
- **Recommendation**: Wait for January validation before any additional loosening

### Capital Scaling Realities
- **Minimum viable**: $5K (commission drag <0.3% at 2% sizing)
- **Recommended start**: $10K+ (better risk management)
- **Commission impact**: At $2K capital with 2% sizing → $40 orders → 0.5-0.75% drag
- **Scaling path**: Double capital each year if 8-12% returns validated

### Correlation Risk (Multi-Symbol)
- **Tech stocks**: TSLA/AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/SPY typically 0.7-0.9 correlated
- **Position limits**: Max 2 concurrent if correlation < 0.75, else max 1
- **Monitoring**: 30-day rolling correlation between active positions
- **Diversification**: Consider TLT (bonds), GLD (gold), XLE (energy) for true diversification

   - Comprehensive manual monitoring guide
   - All commands for detailed analysis
   - Troubleshooting reference

5. **docs/DOC_AUDIT_2025-12-22.md** (NEW):
   - Comprehensive audit of all 17 markdown files
   - 92% health score, 3 issues identified
   - Cleanup recommendations

6. **docs/SESSION_HANDOFFS/** (NEW):
   - Directory for ephemeral session logs
   - Moved CURRENT_SESSION_HANDOFF.md here as 2025-12-19.md

   - Directory for deprecated documentation
   - TRAINING.md moved here (brain ensemble abandoned)

8. **docs/INDEX.md** (UPDATED):

   - Added Maximum Returns Path note

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Immediate**: Daily monitoring (run daily_health_check.ps1)
2. **January**: Validate Phase 3 with 5-15 real trades
3. **February**: Decide on Maximum Returns Path Phase 1 (multi-symbol expansion)
4. **2026**: Execute phases 1-2 (realistic 8-12% return target)

## Key Learnings

1. **Realistic Expectations**: Most likely outcome is 8-12% annual return (Phases 1-2 only, 70% confidence), not full 18-22%
2. **Filter Discipline**: Current filters already loosened 2-3x from backtest; further loosening is high risk (baseline was losing)
3. **Correlation Matters**: Tech stocks crash together; need dynamic position limits and true diversification
4. **Timeline Reality**: Development takes longer than planned (Phase 1+2 took 6 weeks already), monetization is 2-4 year journey
5. **Capital Requirements**: $5K minimum realistic, $10K+ recommended for proper risk management

## Session Status
- **Date**: December 19-22, 2025
- **Duration**: 3-day strategic planning and operational setup session
- **Outcome**: Maximum Returns Path designed, daily monitoring setup, documentation cleaned
- **Bot Health**: Excellent (PID 46592, 72+ hours uptime)
- **Next Check**: Daily until January validation window
